# DrosophilaNuclearTracking

## Intro
This is a python project with two goals: (1) To provide the batch scripts and notebooks that I use in the post-fusion processing of drosophila histone-tagged embryos. (2) To provide user-friendly notebooks for the visualization and analysis of the resulting datasets. So, this project is divided into two subdirectories to tackle these separate purposes.

## Installing dependencies

### Using conda:
navigate to this subdirectory, then run
`conda create -f environment.yml`
to install the required dependencies. You can use `conda activate dnt` to activate the resulting conda environment.


### Using venv:

if you're having trouble creating the conda environment, try creating a venv and installing the following packages through pip:

  - "napari[all]"
  - blender-tissue-cartography
  - seaborn
  - ipynb_path
  - glasbey
